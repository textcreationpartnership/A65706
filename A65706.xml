            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51913:18"/>as are the <hi>Carpocratians.</hi> Here then is undeniable conviction that what the <hi>Second Nicene Council</hi> have decreed to be the Worſhip due unto the Images of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and all the <hi>bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;</hi> and what the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth daily practiſe, was deemed, in the <hi>purer Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> a practice proper to the vileſt <hi>Hereticks. They have theſe Images,</hi> ſay the <hi>Fathers; They offer Incenſe, and bow down to them;</hi> and in this <hi>they do like Heathens,</hi> and therefore not like <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> Therefore the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of thoſe Ages did not ſo; for what is more abſurd, than to reprove theſe <hi>Hereticks</hi> for doing that which the beſt of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> daily practiſed?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Arguments of the Fathers againſt the Worſhip of Heathen Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, conclude equally againſt thoſe now uſed by Chriſtians as, <hi>v. g. 1.</hi> That it was incongruous to worſhip or bow down to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were made of Earth, inſenſate Earth, the ſame with that of which Veſſels were made for common uſes, and they were ſenſual Objects, and therefore were not to be adored, but trod up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, contemned, and caſt away. <hi>§. 1. 2ly,</hi> Becauſe they were worſe than Beaſts, imperfect Inſects, and dead Things, which yet it would be a vile and unbecoming thing for Men to bow down to. <hi>§. 2. 3ly,</hi> Becauſe the Artificer who made them was better, whom yet 'twas ſhameful to adore, that being the Works of Mens Hands, they could not be holy, valuable, acceptable to God, and ſo not fit to be adored; that the Works of God were not to be adored in honour of him, much leſs the Works of Mens hands in honour of the Saints. <hi>§. 3. 4ly,</hi> That Man, who was the Image of God, and was made upright, was not to adore the Images of Men, or venerate earthly Things. <hi>§. 4. 5ly,</hi> Becauſe if what they worſhipped were Heavenly Powers, they would laugh at, or be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with ſuch Worſhippers if they were in Heaven; it were better neglecting Images to look up thither; that if Images were made for the commemortion of the Dead, or of the Abſent, they were not to be worſhipped. <hi>§. 5. 6ly,</hi> Becauſe Images were dangerous,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51913:18"/>as tending to debaſe the Soul, and render the Divine Majeſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible. <hi>§. 6. 7ly,</hi> Becauſe they were the Invention of the Devil. <hi>§. 7.</hi> That the Fathers could not have ſpoken theſe things, which equally conclude againſt all Image-worſhip, if they themſelves had worſhipped Images. <hi>§. 8.</hi> That had this been their practice, the Heathens muſt have then retorted theſe things, as afterwards they did. <hi>§. 9.</hi> That many of theſe Sayings of the Fathers are expreſly condemned in the Second <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. <hi>§. 10.</hi> That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath perſecuted many for ſaying the ſame things, and forced them to renounce them as great Hereſies. <hi>§. 11.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis will be farther evident, if we conſider the Objections which the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> make againſt that worſhip of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which had obtained in the <hi>Heathen</hi> World. For they produce ſuch Arguments againſt it, as equally deſtroy <hi>all Image-worſhip,</hi> whatſoever be the Object repreſented by the Image; and do as fully prove it is unlawful to worſhip Images of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of departed <hi>Saints,</hi> as to adore the Images of <hi>Heathen Deities:</hi> ſo that it muſt be granted, that either in their days <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did neither bow to, nor proſtrate themſelves before the Images of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> or the <hi>Saints</hi> departed; or that they practiſed that which they themſelves moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently reproved in the <hi>Heathens.</hi> Now theſe Arguments of the <hi>Fathers</hi> are taken; (1.) From the conſideration of Images themſelves: And here they argue,</p>

               <p>§. 10. <hi>3ly,</hi> Let us reflect a little upon the Language and Deportment of thoſe who have profeſſedly admitted of the Veneration of the Images of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and of his <hi>Saints,</hi> and ſee if we find any thing reſembling theſe Sayings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> in their Words or Actions. Since that this Image-worſhip hath obtained amongſt the <hi>Latins,</hi> who ever heard ſuch Language from them?</p>
               <p>What <hi>Romaniſt</hi> will ſay, <hi>The Chriſtian Doctrine did not permit them to be ſollicitous about Images and Statues, but to relinquiſh them, to reject them;</hi> that <hi>Chriſt came to cauſe them to deſiſt from the worſhip of them,</hi> and <hi>to elevate them from earthly Images to Heaven?</hi> Who of them will declare, That all the Images of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin,</hi> which they ſolemnly adore at <hi>Rome,</hi> were <hi>falſly called Images;</hi> that they were <hi>worſe than Mice, and Worms, and Moles?</hi> Who of them will pronounce it <hi>an inſignificant and needleſs, a ridiculous, ſhameful, fooliſh, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, perverſe, impious, irreligious, heretical, heatheniſh,</hi> and <hi>deviliſh practice, to adore an Image or a Statue?</hi> Where ſhall we find amongſt them theſe general Axioms, That <hi>Chriſtians muſt not worſhip that which is a Creature, that which hath no ſenſe;</hi> that <hi>it is impious and fooliſh to adore the Work of Mens hands;</hi> that <hi>this ſhould be no part of the Religion of a Chriſtian;</hi> that <hi>it is folly to adore the Dead, or Abſent, and much more folly to adore their Images;</hi> that <hi>the Devil brought into the World the Artificers of Images and Statues?</hi> Since then the <hi>Fathers,</hi> without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or exception, do frequently aſſert theſe things, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more of a like nature, it is evident they did not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or bow down to Images, as do the Members of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> For if no Man would thus ſpeak, who mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do, ſurely theſe <hi>Fathers</hi> were far enough from their Opinions. Is any Man ſo void of underſtanding, that being only to declare that Earthly Princes are not to be obey'd and reverenced <hi>as Gods,</hi> he ſhould continually teach, without all limitation and diſtinction, <hi>That Earthly Princes are not to be obeyed or reverenced?</hi> ſince then the <hi>Fathers</hi> generally ſay, That
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51913:24"/>
                  <hi>Images are not to be admitted or reverenced</hi> by any <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and that <hi>they ought not to bow down to them,</hi> and do not limit theſe Expreſſions, it is exceeding clear that they intended not only to declare they were not to be worſhipped with <hi>Latria,</hi> but alſo that no outward and inferior Worſhip ſhould be given to them.</p>
               <p>After the introduction of Image-worſhip into the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and ſome <hi>Weſtern Churches,</hi> we find their Language and their Practice as oppoſite to theſe Diſcourſes of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as is Light to Darkneſs.

               <p n="1">1. That he declares it <hi>contrary to the Authority of Scripture, to hang up in the Church of Chriſt the Image of a Man:</hi> He doth not ſay the Image of a <hi>wicked Man,</hi> but ſimply, and without all diſtinction, <hi>Imaginem Hominis,</hi> the Image of a Man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He clearly doth inſinuate, That, for any thing he knew to the contrary, the Image which he rent was the Image of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or of ſome <hi>Saint;</hi> for <hi>whether it was ſo or no,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I do not well remember:</hi> Whence evident it is, that had it been the Image of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or any of his <hi>Saints,</hi> he would have rent it.
